# HUJI-FUB TEI class (D.Skorinkin): prerequisites


### 1. Install jEdit or make sure you have another XML-aware editor

This is not a critical prerequisite (one can use any XML editor, such as Notepad++, Sublime or OxygenXML), but jEdit is the only free software notepad I know of which has a TEI plugin. [Offical source](http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=download) 

### 2. Try running it

For jEdit you might get asked for Java version 11 or later. Download and install the latest java [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)


#### if jEdit still does not see Java

Still getting `This application requires that java 11 or later be installed on your computer.` error? Check solutions here: [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/426713/how-to-help-the-jedit-application-find-java](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/426713/how-to-help-the-jedit-application-find-java)
On MacOS you can also just 'Open Package Contents' go to the Java folder and run 'jedit.jar' file, this will launch jEdit.

### 3. Get the TEI plugin for jEdit
