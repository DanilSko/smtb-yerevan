# HUJI-FUB TEI class (D.Skorinkin): prerequisites


### 1. Install jEdit or make sure you have another XML-aware editor

This is not a critical prerequisite (one can use any XML editor, such as Notepad++, TextWrangler or OxygenXML), but jEdit is the only free software notepad I know of which has a TEI plugin. [Offical source](http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=download) 

### 2. Try running it

For jEdit you might get asked for Java version 11 or later. Download and install the latest java [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

### 3. Get the TEI plugin for jEdit
