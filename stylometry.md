# HUJI-FUB Stylometry class (D.Skorinkin): prerequisites

### 1. Install R 

R is free software. You can download it on the official R website: https://www.r-project.org/
If you already have R and it's not too old (any version newer than 3.3.3 will do) 

### 2. Install R studio

Rstudio is free software. It is a handy IDE for R. Technically this step is not indispensable: Stylo can be used with basic vanilla R console that you have after step 1. But in rare cases there are some nasty bugs which persist in R console but disappear in Rstudio. Therefore I'd recommend getting Rstudio if possible.

### 3. Run R studio (or R console) and type `install.packages('stylo')`
